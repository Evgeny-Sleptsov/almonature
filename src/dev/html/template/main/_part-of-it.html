                    The profits generated by the sales of Almo Nature’s food for cats and dogs don’t benefit an individual or an investment fund, but nature as a whole, through Fondazione Capellino.

                    Almo Nature and Fondazione Capellino represent an innovative <strong>duality,</strong> an economic and solidary model whose only purpose is protecting dogs, cats and biodiversity through the projects it runs and develops.

                    You, too, can be a part of it, as someone who shares the same values and/or prefers Almo Nature products to other brands because you contribute to the Foundation’s purpose whenever you purchase our products. And all this in maximum transparency
